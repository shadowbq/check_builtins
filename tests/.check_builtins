# Sample configuration file for check_builtins.sh
# This file demonstrates the whitelist configuration format
# 
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored
#
# To whitelist a command that overrides a builtin, use:
# whitelist <command_name>

# Common commands that users often alias or override
whitelist ls        # Often aliased to 'ls --color=auto'
whitelist grep      # Often aliased to 'grep --color=auto'

# Development tools that may be overridden
whitelist vim       # May be aliased to nvim or other editors
whitelist git       # Sometimes wrapped with custom functions

# System commands that may have legitimate overrides
whitelist find      # Sometimes aliased with common options
whitelist df        # May be aliased with formatting options

# Example of commands you might want to monitor (commented out)
# These would show as overrides if uncommented:
# whitelist cd        # Usually not recommended to override
# whitelist rm        # Potentially dangerous to override
# whitelist sudo      # Security risk if overridden
